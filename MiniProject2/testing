//redundant notifications will happen if a buyer has several interests that overlap.  GUI should remove the redundancy


Errors - Fixes:
//Error: When publishing a bid, the broker would throw an error from the seller publishing the first bidupdate since noone was registered
//to receive updates on it.  
//Fixed: I added a if statement that checks for null values before getting the length of the resulting array (avoid NUllPointerExecption)

//Added: Extra functionality to only send bid updates when necessary
//first bid will check against items minimum price to see if it should set it's new bid leader
//any subsequent bids will see if they are higher than the current max bid

Testing:

Completed Successfully:
//Generate interest, item, and bid between a buyer and a seller on 1 broker
//Generate interest, item, and a bid from a buyer not sharing a broker with the seller
//Generate interest, item, and bidding war between buyers on different brokers with a seller on the master broker

//A first time bid that does not meet the minimum bid value for an item is ignored
//Subsequent bids that are higher than the current highest bidder will generate a bid update

//BidUpdate seems to be functioning correctly



To-Do:
//Add functionality for SaleFinalized
//Add functionality for Buyer auto bid
