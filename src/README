SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) You may need to tell the setup file about your computer network to simulate the distributed auction system.
Since this program assumes some port addresses for brokers, this may conflict with your computer's reserved
ports for other programs.  In order to manually set the ports used by this program:
	Navigate to src -> setup -> Init.java

Change the lines:
	public static int MASTERPORT = 4000;
	public static int[] BROKERINDEX = {4001,4002,4003,4004};
	
to the ports that are available for your system.

2) The default setup only runs with 6 Buyers/Sellers.  In order to scale this number, you must create a new
Broker in the brokers package.  Copy and paste the code from Broker1 and rename to BrokerX (e.g. 3).  Make sure
that you change the port that it listens on to the next value in the array Init.BROKERINDEX[X] (e.g. 2).

Then you will be
